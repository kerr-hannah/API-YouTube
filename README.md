# Overview
This project explores using RESTful API's to collect and use data for analysis. My partner and I decided to use YouTube's API service. We wanted to analyze data on trending YouTube videos; such as the relationship between the number of views a video has and the number of likes or dislikes it has received. Or what, if any, common keywords exist among popular videos, and what the categories different popular videos fall under.

There are three parts to this project. Part one (not included in repository) handles the user authorization using OAuth2.

# Part Two
The second part is where we used the API to actually collect the data and perform some exploratory analysis. Using sqlalchemy, pandas, and matplotlib, some of our initial findings and the raw data collected can be see. This data represents the top 200 trending videos from December 11, 2017.

# Part three
This final part of the project gathers the data collected in part two and more formally investigates some of the properties or themes among trending videos. All graphics were generated using Tableau.
